But programming languages haven't kept up.

We present a number of extensions to the Scala programming language which aim to
provide a more reliable foundation on which to build distributed systems.

% programs and systems which
% are in some sense distributed.

A goal of this dissertation is to revisit the fundamental concepts of modern
languages, objects and functions, and to make them safer and more efficient to
use in a distributed environment. We focus on three important and orthogonal
building blocks for distributed programming.

This thesis presents a new approach to serialization based on .

As a functional programming language 



Finally, we bring together above building blocks, pickling and spores to form
the basis of a new programming model called {\em function-passing},
