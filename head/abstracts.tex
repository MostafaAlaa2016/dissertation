Software development has taken a fundamental turn. Software today has gone from
simple, closed programs running on a single machine, to massively open programs,
patching together user experiences byway of responses received via hundreds of
network requests spanning multiple machines. At the same time, as data continues
to stockpile, systems for big data analytics are on the rise. Yet despite this
trend towards distributing computation, issues at the level of the language and
runtime abound. Serialization is still a costly runtime affair, crashing running
systems and confounding developers. Function closures are being added to APIs
for big data processing for use by end-users without reliably being able to
transmit them over the network. And much of the frameworks developed for
handling multiple concurrent requests byway of asynchronous programming
facilities rely on blocking threads, causing serious scalability issues.

This thesis describes a number of extensions and libraries for the Scala
programming language that aim to address these issues and to provide a more
reliable foundation on which to build distributed systems.

\vspace{0.2cm}

This thesis presents a new approach to serialization called {\em pickling} based
on the idea of generating and composing functional pickler combinators
statically. The approach shifts the burden of serialization to compile time as
much as possible, enabling users to catch serialization errors at compile time
rather than at runtime. Further, by virtue of serialization code being generated
at compile time, our framework is shown to be significantly more performant than
other state-of-the-art serialization frameworks. We also generalize our
technique for generating serialization code to  generic functions other than pickling.

\vspace{0.2cm}

Second, in light of the trend of distributed data-parallel frameworks
being designed around functional patterns where closures are transmitted across
cluster nodes to large-scale persistent datasets, this thesis introduces a new
closure-like abstraction and type system, called {\em spores}, that can
guarantee closures to be serializable, thread-safe, or even have custom
user-defined properties. Crucially, our system is based on the principle of
encoding type information corresponding to captured variables in the type of a
spore. We prove our type system sound, implement our approach for Scala,
evaluate its practicality through a small empirical study, and show the power of
these guarantees through a case analysis of real-world distributed and
concurrent frameworks that this safe foundation for closures facilitates.

\vspace{0.2cm}

Finally, we bring together the above building blocks, pickling and spores, to
form the basis of a new programming model called {\em function-passing}.
Function-passing is based on the idea of a distributed persistent data structure
which stores in its nodes transformations to data rather than the distributed
data itself, simplifying fault recovery by design. Lazy evaluation is also
central to our model; by incorporating laziness into our design only at the
point of initiating network communication, our model remains easy to reason
about while remaining efficient in time and memory. We formalize our programming
model in the form of a small-step operational semantics which includes a precise
specification of the semantics of functional fault recovery, and we provide an
open-source implementation of our model in and for Scala.




% A goal of this dissertation is to revisit the fundamental concepts of modern
% languages, objects and functions, and to make them safer and more efficient to
% use in a distributed environment. We focus on three important and orthogonal
% building blocks for distributed programming.



% But programming languages haven't kept up.

% We present a number of extensions to the Scala programming language which aim to
% provide a more reliable foundation on which to build distributed systems.

% programs and systems which
% are in some sense distributed.
