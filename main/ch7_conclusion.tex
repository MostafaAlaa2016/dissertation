Conclusion and Future Work.

\section{Future Work}

\paragraph{Function-Passing} A great deal of future work remains. In the
short-term, we aim to continue to build different sorts of distributed
frameworks and applications atop F-P in an effort to work towards a
production-ready implementation of our model for consumption by the Scala
community at large.

In the long-term, we plan to better understand concerns of separate compilation
in order to evaluate whether our model could be of help in coordinating between
microservices.\footnote{Microservices are small, independent
(separately-compiled) services running on different machines which communicate
with each other to together make up a single and complex application. They are a
predominant trend in industry amongst rich and complicated web-based services.}

More benchmarks, experience building real systems.
